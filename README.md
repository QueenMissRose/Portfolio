## Lessons Learned

Throughout the process of creating my portfolio, I gained valuable insights and skills. I learned how to read and understand other people's code, as well as how to integrate my own code into existing templates. This was my first experience using a template, and I initially expected it to be straightforward. However, I found that adapting it to fit my own vision was quite challenging at times.

Additionally, it was my first time working with Bootstrap and JavaScript, which were already incorporated into the template. This experience pushed me to deepen my understanding of both technologies, as I navigated the learning curve and explored how they could enhance my project.
